## Product Description

The Multi Timeframe Support and Resistance Zones MT4 is a powerful tool for traders who rely on support and resistance analysis in their trading strategy. It automatically calculates support and resistance zones for three different timeframes: 15 minutes, 1 hour, and 4 hours.

### Features

- Support and resistance zone calculation for multiple timeframes
- Customizable input parameters for timeframes
- Alerts when price interacts with support or resistance zones
- Display of support and resistance zones on the chart

### How it Works

1. Input Parameters: The program allows you to define three timeframes for which you want to calculate support and resistance zones. By default, the timeframes are set to 15 minutes, 1 hour, and 4 hours.

2. Calculation of Zones: The `CalculateZones()` function calculates the support and resistance zones for each timeframe. It uses the lowest and highest prices of each timeframe to determine the zones.

3. Interactions with Zones: The `InteractsWithZone()` function checks if the current price is within any of the support or resistance zones. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the price is interacting with any zone.

4. Alert Generation: The `GenerateAlert()` function generates an alert if the current price interacts with any support or resistance zone. It checks the interaction for each timeframe and triggers an alert if there is a match.

5. Display of Zones: The `OnStart()` function is the entry point of the program. It calls the `CalculateZones()` function to calculate the zones and then calls the `GenerateAlert()` function to check for interactions. Finally, it prints the support and resistance zones to the chart using the `Comment()` function.
